                        Bagan (Burmese: ပုဂံ; MLCTS: pu.gam, IPA: [bəɡàɰ̃]; formerly Pagan)
                        is an ancient city and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the 
                        Mandalay Region of Myanmar.[1] From the 9th to 13th centuries, 
                        the city was the capital of the Pagan Kingdom, the first kingdom 
                        that unified the regions that would later constitute Myanmar. 
                        During the kingdom's height between the 11th and 13th centuries,
                         more than 10,000 Buddhist temples, pagodas and monasteries were 
                         constructed in the Bagan plains alone,[2] of which the remains 
                         of over 2200 temples and pagodas survive.
